This project is a version of my previous SPH Fluid Simulation project:
https://github.com/RobiGavranovic/SPH-Fluid-Simulation
In this version i use distributed computing, however due to the nature of distributed programs this version of the project has no visuals and is purely mathematical.

This was created as an end project for my subject of Programming 3 at University of Primorska, Koper. 
It is inspired by Mitchel Sayer's project: https://github.com/mitchellsayer/Smoothed-Particle-Hydrodynamics/tree/master

Mitchel's project helped me understand the mathematics behind SPH fluid simulating and definetly sped up my development process,
therefore i want to show my gratitude to Mitchel for allowing me to use his project as a reference; Thank you.
